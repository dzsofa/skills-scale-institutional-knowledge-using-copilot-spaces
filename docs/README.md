This README provides an overview and entry point for all OctoAcme project management processes and best practices.

## About OctoAcme Project Management

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to deliver customer value efficiently and reliably. Our process emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, psychological safety, and continuous improvement.

### Core Principles
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning
